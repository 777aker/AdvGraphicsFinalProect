Final Project for Advanced Computer Graphics

Soooo...I could've done what I was originally planning with the whole forest thing, bbuuuttttt, that was really lame to me and felt like I was just putting shaders on my last project and it'd be mostly the same just like, better. And that was lame. So instead, I decided to make a star formation simulator. 

What remains to be done: 
well I think fusing cells need to repel each other not just collide
I want to include angular momentum conservation
(or cheat so it looks like it is rotating faster as it collapses)
fusing cells could run out of energy so it starts collapsing on itself and then 
go into the next star phase
basically I just need to figure out what happens to the star after fusion
and probably tweak the fusion a little bit because right now the fusion isn't repelling it's just fake weird collisions
I just tried a million different formulas and numbers until it looked right
and so I wanna go through and fix it up
After that though, I don't know

Time spent: 12 hr
2 hrs doing the last project, then getting bored and deleting it all
4 hrs transferring ex22 and ex19 into this and messing with different ways to split up the work (was trying to do x y z all on different threads but slowed it down more)
2 hrs relearning physics and totally not understanding how to do 3d collisions
https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-physics/chapter/collisions/
4 hrs faking physics until it looked like what I wanted
Basically the physics in the compute shader are mostly copied from ex22 but
I did a lot of tweaking for the collisions

Key bindings:
esc - quit
0 - reset view
r - reset particles
arrows - change view
pgup/pgdn - zoom in and out
